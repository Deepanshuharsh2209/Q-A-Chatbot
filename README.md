# RAG based multiple document chatbot

•Developed an interactive Q&A application using Python and Streamlit to query multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX,
TXT).

•Integrated Google Generative AI Embeddings and FAISS for vector storage and efficient document retrieval.

•Employed ChatGroq for dynamic, multi-turn conversations and maintained context with ConversationBufferMemory.

•Designed a user-friendly interface for real-time document querying and chat history management.

• Implemented Guardrails to prevent hallucination, misinformation propagation, and prompt injection.

Objective : This chatbot will help users efficiently retrieve and understand information from multiple documents by
leveraging natural language processing, embeddings, and conversational AI models for dynamic, context-aware responses.

## Interface of Application.

I have used *Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition* paper as input pdf and asked application to give a summary.
